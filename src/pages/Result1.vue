    <h5>NASDAQ:JD</h5>
    <p>Electronic products such as computers, mobile phones and cameras are the first choice for JD.com. It should only be JD.com. Why? 
        Because JD.comâ€™s self-service after-sales is good. In addition, JD.com is basically genuine.

    <h5>TaoBao</h5>
    <p>Tmall Taobao is the first choice for clothing, such as shoes, pants, bed sheets, and quilts. Why, because there are so many categories, Jingdong is far behind, so you can choose slowly. 
        The quality of Tmall can also be that the after-sales service is too painful. One word category wins more.

    <p>Small things, such as bowls and chopsticks, socks, pens, water cups and the like are things with a unit price of less than 30 yuan. 
        I will fight for a lot of things. Even if the gadgets are fake, where can they be faked? Affect my normal use.

    <h5>XianYv</h5>
    <p>Xianyu is an idle trading platform owned by Alibaba. It is an idle trading platform for buying and selling second-hand products. 
        The advantage of salted fish is the real-name transaction, which is relatively safe for second-hand goods transactions.
